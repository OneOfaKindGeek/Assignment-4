  // Part 1
    // var z;  alert(typeof z); this line of code will be comes up as undefined when put into javascript because it is not coded right 
  //  alert(!!false); an alert window will pop up saying false on it 
  //  alert(7%2);    an alert window will pop up saying 1 on it because % means Modulus and it is a division remainder
   //    var name="Jim"; alert(name+" Smith"); pop up window will show up saying Jim smith because you made a variable called"name" which = Jim and with the alert you'll make the name pop up with "jim" with the addition of smith in the alert becauce of the + and "smith" 
    //    var myNum="5"; alert(myNum+2); will pop up window saying 52, cause the variable called mynum equals 5 and in the alert it will show up will a 2 because of the addition sign 
        
        // part 3
        
var userOut=prompt("what is your name?")
var upper = userOut.toUpperCase();
for (i=1; i<=3; i++) {
document.write("Welcome "+upper+"!<br>");
}

    <!-- Part 2 
        1. The important differences between Java and Javascript is that Java is an object oriented programming language and  can run in any browser. JavaScript is an object based scripting language and is developed for browser only.
        2. + works with in variables, it adds things together basic addition sign. while "++" means increments example "var x = 5;x++;var z = x;"
        3.  console.log("") outputs whatever is passed as the parameter. document.write("") adds whatever you want to html. Alerts are used to alert end users who access the web page 
        4."=" means a variable equals something like "x=5". The '==' operator tests for abstract equality meaning it does the necessary type conversions before doing the equality comparison. But the '===' operator tests for strict equality meaning it will not do the type conversion hence if the two values are not of the same type, when compared, it will return false. Basically it works within booleans
        5. The main difference between a while loop and do while loop is that while loop check condition before iteration of the loop, whereas do-while loop, checks the condition after the execution of the statements inside the loop.
